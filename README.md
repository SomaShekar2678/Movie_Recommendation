# Recommender System Project 

# Introduction
This project involves building a recommender system using a dataset containing ratings and tags applied to movies by users. The goal is to predict user ratings for movies they have not yet rated. Recommender systems are crucial in many applications, especially in providing personalized recommendations in e-commerce, streaming services, and social media platforms.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 600 users. It consists of the following files:

movies.csv: Contains movie information with columns for movieId, title, and genres.
ratings.csv: Contains user ratings for movies with columns for userId, movieId, rating, and timestamp.
tags.csv: Contains user tags for movies with columns for userId, movieId, tag, and timestamp.
links.csv: Contains identifiers that can be used to link to other sources.

# Data Preprocessing
In this section, we load the data and perform necessary preprocessing steps. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

# Handling Missing Values
We check for and handle any missing values in the dataset.

# Splitting the Data
The data is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

# Model Selection and Training
We explore different models suitable for recommender systems, including matrix factorization techniques, neural collaborative filtering, and deep learning-based approaches.

# Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are popular for recommender systems. They decompose the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors representing users and items.

# Neural Collaborative Filtering
Neural collaborative filtering uses neural networks to learn user and item representations.

# Deep Learning-Based Approaches
Deep learning models, including autoencoders and neural collaborative filtering, are employed to capture complex patterns in user-item interactions.

# Evaluation and Results
We evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

# Evaluation Metrics
RMSE: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual ratings.
MAE: Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual ratings.

# Results
The results are presented and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the recommender system.

# Conclusion
In this project, we built a recommender system using a dataset of movie ratings and tags. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated using RMSE and MAE. The findings suggest that the implemented model provides accurate recommendations, though there is room for improvement. Future work could involve exploring advanced techniques such as hybrid models that combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, as well as incorporating additional features such as user demographics.
